# The Three Tenets
In the introduction to this book, I have said that each chapter would give you practical examples along with some principles to guide you.

Well, I lied. This chapter is exclusively theoretical: its purpose is to set the tone and the spirit in which we'll be doing _all_ of our upcoming work.

Pretty much all of the suggestions in this book are derived from _The Three Tenets_ (or "TTT") and can be disregarded and/or swapped for ones that work better for you, but not the tenets themselves. Their scope is broad and their effectiveness wildly acknowledged. In other words, don't follow them and bad things will happen to you (and your children).

Without further ado, here are the simplest possible formulations of the tenets:

1. Be Boring
2. Embrace HTTP
3. Respect REST

Let's elaborate a bit more and see what all the fuss is about.
